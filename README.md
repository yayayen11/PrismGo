## Overview

PrismGo is a experimental search engine forked from KataGo (https://github.com/lightvector/KataGo). PrismGo was forked for tests and other purposes. 

## License

Except for several external libraries that have been included together in this repo under `cpp/external/` as well as the single file `cpp/core/sha2.cpp`, which all have their own individual licenses, all code and other content in this repo is released for free use or modification under the license in the following file: [LICENSE](LICENSE).

License aside, if you end up using any of the code in this repo to do any of your own cool new self-play or neural net training experiments, I (lightvector) would to love hear about it.
